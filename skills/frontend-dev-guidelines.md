# React Native Development Guidelines

## Purpose

Comprehensive guide for modern React Native development with TypeScript, Expo Router, React Navigation, Redux Toolkit, NativeWind, and React Native Paper. Supports both the New Architecture and classic bridge architecture.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating new components or screens
- Building new features
- Fetching data with Axios + TanStack Query
- Setting up navigation with Expo Router or React Navigation
- Styling components with NativeWind 4.x (Tailwind CSS)
- Using React Native Paper components
- Form handling with React Hook Form + Zod
- TypeScript best practices
- Platform-specific code (iOS/Android)
- Camera/vision integration
- Real-time features with WebRTC/WebSocket

## Quick Start

### New Screen Checklist (Expo Router)

Creating a screen with Expo Router? Follow this checklist:

1. Create screen file in `app/` directory (file-based routing)
2. Use NativeWind 4.x for styling
3. Add TypeScript types
4. Handle loading/error states
5. Configure layout if needed (`_layout.tsx`)

### New Screen Checklist (React Navigation)

Creating a screen with React Navigation? Follow this checklist:

1. Create screen component in `src/screens/`
2. Add navigation route to navigator
3. Use NativeWind for styling
4. Add TypeScript types for route params
5. Handle loading/error states

### New Component Checklist

Creating a component? Follow this checklist:

1. Create in `src/components/` or `components/`
2. Use NativeWind 4.x classes
3. Add proper TypeScript props interface
4. Consider platform differences (iOS/Android)
5. Add accessibility props where appropriate
